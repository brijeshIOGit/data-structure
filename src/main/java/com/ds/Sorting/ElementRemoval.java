Problem Description
Given an integer array A of size N. You can remove any element from the array in one operation.
The cost of this operation is the sum of all elements in the array present before this operation.

Find the minimum cost to remove all elements from the array.



Problem Constraints
0 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A[i] <= 103



Input Format
First and only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the total cost of removing all elements from the array.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [2, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [5]


Example Output
Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 5


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Given array A = [2, 1]
 Remove 2 from the array => [1]. Cost of this operation is (2 + 1) = 3.
 Remove 1 from the array => []. Cost of this operation is (1) = 1.
 So, total cost is = 3 + 1 = 4.
Explanation 2:

 There is only one element in the array. So, cost of removing is 5.

/*

Solution Approach
Let’s find the count of how many times an element will contribute to the answer.

Remove any element from the array. The cost of this operation is equal to the sum of array elements irrespective of which element gets removed.

If we remove another element from the array, the cost of this operation will be ( cost of the previous operation - the element which gets removed in the last operation.)

So, we can easily observe that it is wise to remove the highest element first to make the total cost minimum, and elements also follow a pattern.

Element removed first will be added 1 time to the answer.
Element removed second will be added 2 times to the answer.
Element removed third will be added 3 times to the answer.
.

.
So on.

We can easily find the total cost in one single loop.
